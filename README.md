# TopDungeon
 2D Top Down Dungeon Crawler Game Created with the Unity Engine
 
Techniques from class:
1. Touch Input: The joystick and the attack button
2. Animation: The torches, actor movementes, and the sword swinging.
3. Collision/Physics: There's a force applied to the actors during combat since they all have a collide box 2d, as well as the sword. The crates, healing fountain, and portals all functions using collisions.
4. Procedural Levels: I have a tuorial level (the main level) and a dungeon level in the game.
5. UI: I have a UI displaying the current weapon, pesos needed for upgrading the weapon, the player's current skin, the player's health, experience, and the number of pesos in its pocket. Also, there's a hp bar and xp bar in the UI.
